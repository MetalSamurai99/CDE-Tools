Running Applications

 To run one of these applications, just double click on the icon in
the Application Manager window, or drag a document file from a File
Manager Window onto the icon.

Easier Access

 If you use applications (or documents) frequently, you can put them
on the workspace. Press the right button on the icon to bring up
a menu and choose ``Put in Workspace'', or drag the icon to a clear
space on the Workspace. You can still drag documents to the new icon,
or double click to launch the application.

 Alternatively, you can add the application to one of the Front Panel
pop up menus. Click on the arrow tab to bring up the menu, then drag
the application to the Install Icon drop target. If the Front Panel
section you want the application to appear in does not have a pop up
menu, then press the right mouse button and choose ``Add Subpanel''.


 See the built in CDE help for more information on the Application
Manager and the Front Panel.
